## üõ† Technolgies

### Figma

- This project was designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/about/). Figma allows designers and developers to work together while allowing each party to focus on their respective task. My role was to create the webpage based on the designed depicted in the Figma document. The designer create template that depict what the page should look like at various dimensions. My job was to impliment this design right down to the pixel.

### Images

- Images make for a nice visual experience. Large images make for a not so nice loading experience. I compressed all the images using [this tool](https://tinypng.com/), so the project loads faster while still looking wonderful.

### Media Queries

- I used [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) to check the size of the user's window and display content according to how it might best be viewed. No matter if you're viewing the page on a giant desktop screen, or the smallest smartphone screen, the page will adapt and still look good.
